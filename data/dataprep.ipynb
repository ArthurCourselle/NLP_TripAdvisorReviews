         "This is my favorite hotel in Chicago, and I've stayed at all the top luxury properties (Four Seasons, Hyatts etc). I've stayed at this hotel 20+ times, it's a hidden gem. Right on the lakefront, there's a beach across the street from the hotel, and if you get a lake view room (be sure to ask), you'll spend some quality zen time gazing at the water. Regardless of which room you get, you can leave your window shades open because you have beautiful views in every direction plus no one overlooking you. \nRooms are fantastic - I love the clever, well-designed furniture and fittings, simple, minimal, and very well-designed. Honey-colored lighting plus a multiplicity of window treatments (blackout shades plus twig shades plus sheer sun shades) means that you can adjust the lighting to make yourself feel cheerful and relaxed. The bathroom is gorgeous, plus clever 'window' out to main room means excellent ventilation and light. \nThe huge lobby is my favorite hangout in Chicago. The ground-floor location means you're connected to the street-level location and yet the plush chairs, sofas etc mean that you totally zen out and relax. I always try to conduct business meetings in the lobby - plenty of space, beautiful room and excellent food/drinks menu and service means that my guest invariably remarks 'wow, this is a great place, I've never been here before.' I've won almost every negotiation conducted in the lobby, ply your opponents with drinks plus finger food plus a terry cloth robe and they will give you all that you want :)\nAlso love the staff - they totally deal with whatever questions I have or help that I need. This is an EXCELLENT hotel for BUSINESS travelers, the staff is exceptionally helpful running meetings, handling phone calls etc. And special shout-out to the car valet staff and doorman staff - Chicago can be incredibly cold, but the staff always has your car (or taxi) warmed up and waiting for you, I've never met better service. Ever. The front desk also have my airplane boarding passes printed out when I come down to check out, plus a pre-visit call means they will help you maximize spg points etc.\nStay here every time you visit Chicago.",
