         "This is my favorite hotel in Chicago, and I've stayed at all the top luxury properties (Four Seasons, Hyatts etc). I've stayed at this hotel 20+ times, it's a hidden gem. Right on the lakefront, there's a beach across the street from the hotel, and if you get a lake view room (be sure to ask), you'll spend some quality zen time gazing at the water. Regardless of which room you get, you can leave your window shades open because you have beautiful views in every direction plus no one overlooking you. \nRooms are fantastic - I love the clever, well-designed furniture and fittings, simple, minimal, and very well-designed. Honey-colored lighting plus a multiplicity of window treatments (blackout shades plus twig shades plus sheer sun shades) means that you can adjust the lighting to make yourself feel cheerful and relaxed. The bathroom is gorgeous, plus clever 'window' out to main room means excellent ventilation and light. \nThe huge lobby is my favorite hangout in Chicago. The ground-floor location means you're connected to the street-level location and yet the plush chairs, sofas etc mean that you totally zen out and relax. I always try to conduct business meetings in the lobby - plenty of space, beautiful room and excellent food/drinks menu and service means that my guest invariably remarks 'wow, this is a great place, I've never been here before.' I've won almost every negotiation conducted in the lobby, ply your opponents with drinks plus finger food plus a terry cloth robe and they will give you all that you want :)\nAlso love the staff - they totally deal with whatever questions I have or help that I need. This is an EXCELLENT hotel for BUSINESS travelers, the staff is exceptionally helpful running meetings, handling phone calls etc. And special shout-out to the car valet staff and doorman staff - Chicago can be incredibly cold, but the staff always has your car (or taxi) warmed up and waiting for you, I've never met better service. Ever. The front desk also have my airplane boarding passes printed out when I come down to check out, plus a pre-visit call means they will help you maximize spg points etc.\nStay here every time you visit Chicago.",

This is an EXCELLENT hotel for BUSINESS travelers, the staff is exceptionally helpful running meetings, handling phone calls etc. And special shout-out to the car valet staff and doorman staff - Chicago can be incredibly cold, but the staff always has your car (or taxi) warmed up and waiting for you, I've never met better service. Ever. The front desk also have my airplane boarding passes printed out when I come down to check out, plus a pre-visit call means they will help you maximize spg points etc.\nStay here every time you visit Chicago.",

         "Let me start with the positives, although there were only a few. The location for the Sheraton is pretty much the best part of this hotel. You are right on 16th street and in the middle of everything and can get just about anywhere. The concierge was extremely helpful in getting me where I needed to be outside of denver through public transportation in lieu of the wildfires shutting down a lot of the regional service. Now onto the bad stuff. I came to check in and they did not have my reservation. Even though I had my confirmation number and copy of my reservation sheet. There happened to be a sorority convention staying at the hotel, but to not be able to accommodate because of high volume of guests is completely subpar for a large hotel chain. After asking to speak with a manager as the clerks told me I didn't have a room, I was finally cleared to check in. The room was pre-paid and the hotel ended up charging me twice for the one night stay and have still yet to rectify my bill. The hotel is pretty expansive, but the decor needs serious updating and the elevators are extremely sketchy. There were a few times I thought I'd be spending hours in them getting up and down the tower. The rooms are of good size, but the windows make you feel like you're staying in a post-Soviet building as they are tiny concrete slits, at least in the tower portion. Best bed I've slept in though, which was somewhat redeeming. I'm more dissatisfied with the customer service of this hotel than anything else, and for this reason alone I would recommend staying far away from this place and booking elsewhere.",

         "Brilliant hotel\nAfter having read the mixed reviews, I went ahead and booked this hotel. Nervous with what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. On arrival the reception was warm and friendly and the staff marked on a map the places to go and to avoid for us. I loved the feel and look of the hotel and our room was spacious, clean and comfortable. I had seen previous pictures on this website showing mould on the lampshades and there were but it really didn't matter as we were out all day sightseeing. The hotel was in a great location to get to Chinatown and Union Sq roughly a 10-15 min walk and every evening the hotel offered free wine to its guests. I would definitely book again with them.",

         "I have just stayed at this hotel - nice enough but far from special. The worst thing is no car parking, and the guy on reception was not the most helpful in finding me somewhere. The lift was too small and difficult to use for the one luggage cart. I couldn't find any breakfast. Then the bill. I was charged $3 for the internet - you will be charged if you use or not. The final insult was when I asked if we could stay in the room for an extra hour before leaving for the airport. $50 for an hour! I felt that I was being treated like dirt. There are a lot of hotels out there, and I would avoid this one like the plague. The real bonus were the down-and-outs who live outside the front. They were great people to talk to, and it was fascinating to see them all gather when the free food and clothes hand-outs arrived. Great people. Sad for the girl who got beaten up the night of our stay. The Police sorted it out pretty quickly! Finally - the roof terrace (advertised). Great view, nothing up there but a few tatty chairs.",

Upon check in the girl was very nice and told me that she would be putting us in a double. I asked if there was any king beds available and she said yes but it was a $30 upcharge. I thought it was a bit much but I agreed to pay the upcharge. We were put on the 32nd floor with a city view. The view was nice but thats all I can really say about this room. First of all, I'm 5ft 4 and I was able to reach up and touch the ceiling! It made the room feel VERY cramped. The furniture in the room was chipped and worn/rundown in general. The bathroom is so small and the walk in shower has 1 glass door leaving the back of the shower open. I think they are trying to be chic but my husband froze while taking a shower. There is a pass thru opening in the bathroom with run down wooden shutters to close for privacy...wierd layout. The beds were not too bad but we have had better. The windows have blackout shades that are dirty/frayed and then wooden blinds to cover those which were dirty/outdated. Not Impressed at all with this hotel. Bottom line is we will not be returning to The W Lakeshore, there are many other choices out there.",

         "After I landed at o'hare airport and started my search for the renaissance, my lessons started. Firstly i looked up the wrong section in tripadvisor for an airport hotel; on hindsight i should have searched in \"rosemont, illinois\", rather than \"chicago, illinois\" . After i walked past the hilton in the airport on my way to the blue line on the \"L\", my regret started. At the L station, the station workers told me to go to P1 instead where they have hotel buses pick us up. You may be wondering why i never called ahead to ask. Well, this is a strange hotel with no phone number on their website. And of course, they never replied my email. I should have seen the red flags. Unfortunately for me again, by the time i saw their number at the bus bay and called them, i just missed the hotel bus and had to wait for another 30mins in the cold. Go to door 2 by the way\nThis \"airport hotel\" is a rather far 20min away from o'hare airport and the entrance is a very strange, small and non-descript door. Front desk was thankfully efficient, as it was already 1030pm and i didn't have dinner yet. The rooms are all indeed suites, with a seperate living area, but it's not 5 star or anything. The shower stall is large, but the 2 tvs smaller than Apple mac screens. The sink seems to leak, and there's no bathrobe. Room service was ok\nWill try the airport hilton next time",

         "Learnt many lessons\nAfter I landed at o'hare airport and started my search for the renaissance, my lessons started. Firstly i looked up the wrong section in tripadvisor for an airport hotel; on hindsight i should have searched in \"rosemont, illinois\", rather than \"chicago, illinois\" . After i walked past the hilton in the airport on my way to the blue line on the \"L\", my regret started. At the L station, the station workers told me to go to P1 instead where they have hotel buses pick us up. You may be wondering why i never called ahead to ask. Well, this is a strange hotel with no phone number on their website. And of course, they never replied my email. I should have seen the red flags. Unfortunately for me again, by the time i saw their number at the bus bay and called them, i just missed the hotel bus and had to wait for another 30mins in the cold. Go to door 2 by the way\nThis \"airport hotel\" is a rather far 20min away from o'hare airport and the entrance is a very strange, small and non-descript door. Front desk was thankfully efficient, as it was already 1030pm and i didn't have dinner yet. The rooms are all indeed suites, with a seperate living area, but it's not 5 star or anything. The shower stall is large, but the 2 tvs smaller than Apple mac screens. The sink seems to leak, and there's no bathrobe. Room service was ok\nWill try the airport hilton next time",

         "Residence Inn is great hotel chain on the whole. My family always tries to find one when we visit a new US state. There's always comfort, complimentary food, good wifi, a kitchen complete with a tea/coffee service, stove, fridge/freezer, dishwasher & cupboard with dishes. Great if you want to buy groceries & cook your own meals to save money or have a late night snack. \nWhat made this DC location great was that it was a few blocks away from a lot of the main attractions & great restaurants. The hotel supplied me with a four-paged handout list of all nearby restaurants. An added plus is that this particular Residence Inn is right next to a pharmacy that also sells groceries, so everything you need for your room is a few feet away from your door.\nService was great, everyone who worked there was helpful & mannerly. The glass door of the closet was accidentally shattered when we tried to squeeze a huge suitcase into the closet. The front desk sent a repairman to our room to check it out, he left & returned with a new glass door to install and in 12 minutes it was as if nothing had happened. What was even nicer was the fact that the hotel didn't charge our room for the accident.\nI definitely recommend this hotel, especially if you are traveling with family or friends. Just know that they charge (as of April 2012) $29 a night for parking AND that there's a height restriction because the parking lot is underground. Unfortunately, the huge jeep that we rented was too tall to fit into the RI lot, so we had to park up the road in another hotel's parking lot for $32/night. \nIf you can help it, save the cash & don't rent a car at all - regardless of which you hotel you stay in, unless you plan on exploring in your car outside of DC into the wider DMV area. Between the rental fee & insurance and parking fees both at the hotel and around the main streets & major spots in downtown DC, it adds up. Walking is healthier anyway. lol",

Where the service was okay the food was terrible (fat & greasy and the breakfast omelette must have gained me 2 pounds + wasn’t finished cooking and the French fries for my burger came out of frost bags), the water in the room you actually had to pay for (new experience for me, and costly at about $4 a bottle), the showerhead was fixed on the wall at about 180cm and I am 195cm so it wasn’t too easy to shower and my bill was wrong when it appeared under the door (this was corrected by the time I checked out though). I don’t know what the price for the competing hotels are but $370 for two nights and one burger with cola and two breakfasts just isn’t worth it when you top it up with being quite a noisy hotel (you can hear people in the halls and when they flush in their room).",
